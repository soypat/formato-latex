\subsection*{\thesistitle}

Limit the abstract to as few words as possible.  The abstract should always be less than one page long, and less than 400 words.  Be aware that many online referencing systems only allow the first 200 words to be included.  No figures or references should be presented. Avoid extensive technical and method details where possible.  Should be readable to a literate science reader familiar with your general area, but not necessarily experts-only material. This will be published online within 3 months of award of the degree, as a minimum.  The entire thesis must be published within one year, unless restrictions apply (as above).
