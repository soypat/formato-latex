\chapter{Appendices and Supplementary Data} \label{appB}

Unlike a journal article, no data or discussion may be presented separately as unpublished supplementary documents or data.  Appendices should be used instead for material that is tangentially relevant to the thesis but does not fit in the main narrative. If you need to refer to large volumes of data that cannot be printed (such as an annotated genome, or a simulation with moving images), lodge the data on an OIST repository or a public database and provide the URL of the dataset in the thesis.
