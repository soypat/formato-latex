\chapter{Guidelines on the preparation of theses} \label{ch-1}

These guidelines set out the organization and formatting requirements of the OIST PhD thesis, in order to assist students in the preparation of theses for submission. The academic requirements of the thesis are defined in the PRP in section 5.3.13, while the format of the submitted examination and publication versions of the thesis are described here.

This particular documents refers specifically a thesis written in \LaTeX. As such, some points from the full guideline (for example page sizes) are not referenced directly here as they are already defined in this template. Some other points concerning specific pages (for example the abstract) are described in the specific pages themselves in this PDF.

\section{Guidelines on the preparation of theses}

\textbf{Plagiarism and Fraud}:  Students are reminded that they must take all necessary precautions to avoid plagiarism and fraudulent misrepresentations of data. 

\textbf{Reproducibility}: OIST is committed to openness in science, and a cornerstone of this is the concept of reproducibility.  Your thesis should present all the data and methods necessary to allow complete repetition of the experiments and their results, and to allow expert review of your analysis of data.  Accordingly, you must ensure that your methods are comprehensive, and that your data sets and code are available for subsequent review by lodging them in the OIST Institutional Repository or some other data repository or database, as appropriate.

\textbf{Inclusion of Published Material}: In some cases inclusion of published material as chapters is desirable. Normally, however, when published material is included in the thesis, it should be modified in order to remove redundancy and achieve a coherent narrative. It is essential to indicate clearly any portion of the thesis that duplicates parts of articles that were previously published by the candidate. The candidate must cite the article and indicate any parts of a section or chapter of the thesis that depend on the previously published article. This does not apply to previous documents such as thesis proposals and reports written as part of the candidate's research.

An appropriate level of independence on the part of the student is expected. If parts of the thesis are based on published work under joint authorship, the supervisor should provide a statement about the extent to which this is the candidate's own work, as part of the standard supervisor declaration. 

When including material from publications in a thesis, students should be aware of the copyright policies of journals. It is recommended that students request journals to vary their normal copyright agreements to allow material from an article to be included in a thesis (as the thesis will be publicly available through the University's Library). If, for copyright reasons, material from previously published papers may not be included in the electronically published thesis, the electronically published thesis may cite papers that are already published. 

\section{Organization of chapters and sections}

\textbf{Title Page}:  This page is the first printed page, and can be duplicated in whole or part as the front cover in the final bound version.

\textbf{Choice of Title}: Select a descriptive and unique title that clearly communicates your research.  Avoid brief or misleading titles.  The title will be displayed on your graduation testamur.  The title should be unique within OIST, to distinguish your thesis from those of others working on similar topics.

\textbf{Declaration of Original Authorship}:  You must declare that the work is your own, and original,  by signing and including the declaration.  

\textbf{Co-authorship}:  Co-authors are not permitted on an OIST PhD thesis. All research and analysis should be your own work. Where co-authors have contributed to papers arising from the work, you should not include their data unless it is essential for the scientific narrative.  In such cases, full disclosure of the contribution is required. Acknowledge any work performed by others, whether at OIST or outside OIST.

\textbf{Acknowledgements, List of Abbreviations, Glossary, Nomenclature, Dedication, Table of Contents}: Those are commented directly in the template. Glossary, Nomenclature, and Dedication pages are optional.

\textbf{Main body}:  The main body may be arranged as a single body of material, divided into sub-sections of Introduction (including a statement of the problem), Methods, Results, Discussion, or if preferred, in chapters that each deal with a smaller part of the research, each one itself divided into sub-chapters of Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion (or similar), as appropriate. 

\textbf{Reference List}:  Provide a complete numbered list of all material cited in your thesis using BibTeX or BibLaTeX.

\textbf{Appendices}: The printed versions of the thesis may include, as an appendix, published papers; unpublished manuscripts that have been submitted for publication; and manuscripts ready for, or very close to, journal submission.  These should be placed immediately after the final pages of the thesis, and separated from the thesis itself by a single dividing page with the text: ``Previously published articles associated with the research described in this thesis'', or similar. These published papers are included solely for completeness of the bound thesis as a historical record of your achievement, and are for future reference of yourself and the supervisors.  They will not be included in the on-line version of the thesis. Papers co-authored during the period of the thesis that do not include material presented in this work should not be included.

\textbf{Appendices and Supplementary Data}: Unlike a journal article, no data or discussion may be presented separately as unpublished supplementary documents or data.  Appendices should be used instead for material that is tangentially relevant to the thesis but does not fit in the main narrative. If you need to refer to large volumes of data that cannot be printed (such as an annotated genome, or a simulation with moving images), lodge the data on an OIST repository or a public database and provide the URL of the dataset in the thesis.  (see also: Reproducibility, above.)


\section{Formatting Requirements}

\textbf{Page size, Margins, Spacing, Justification, Pagination, Header, Fonts}: those are already built-in the templates. Do not modify them.

\textbf{Equations}: Equations are considered to be part of the text; they should be formatted consistently throughout the thesis, following the advice of the student's supervisor.  

\textbf{Spelling}: American spelling should be used.

\textbf{Printing}:  Theses submitted for examination should be printed double-spaced on one side of a page only (so that when bound in temporary bindings, the right hand page is the printed page).  Temporary bindings may use any reasonable white bond paper, in A4 size.  Laser printing (in black ink wherever possible, and colour for images where necessary), should be used exclusively, rather than alternatives such as ink-jet, dye sublimation, or wax transfer (for durability of the print).  Final bound copies should use acid-free paper (also known as archival paper) to ensure longevity of the thesis in the collection, and should be printed on both sides of the page (single-spaced, with adjusted margins).

\textbf{Colors}:  Colors may be used in images and charts where necessary to enhance comprehension, but should not be used for normal text or headings.  Avoid the exclusive combination of red and green for binary images, to assist those who have difficulty discriminating hues.  All text should be in black unless color-coding is necessary for meaning or contrast.

\textbf{Figues, Tables, Images}: Those are detailed in a later Chapter with examples.

\textbf{Word length}:  No minimum word length is imposed on OIST graduate theses.  However, be concise in your language and succinct in your expression.  The average length of a PhD thesis will vary between fields and between authors, but typical PhD theses are 100-400 pages in length (approximately 20,000-80,000 words of main body text).  

\textbf{Citations}:  All papers that you reference in your work must be referenced in full using a style relevant to your field. Provide the full title, a complete list of authors, and the article location and year of publication in the same style for all papers. Use one of several styles you have been introduced to in previous writing.  Refer to papers in the text by either a numerical superscript, a bracketed number or by reference to (Author et al., 1999).  Be consistent in your citation style throughout all sections of your thesis.  Provide a complete list of all papers, books, and proceedings cited in your thesis at the end of the main body of text.  Do not include papers in this list that were not cited in the thesis.  Reference manager software such as Endnote or similar programs that offer ``Cite-While You Write'' functionality can assist this process greatly if you are using Word. Use BibTeX or BibLaTeX if you are using LaTeX.

Citing one reference can be done like so: \cite{Lee98} and multiple references in one go like so \cite{Fil09, Muc10, Kra27}.

\textbf{Editing}:  The thesis should be entirely your own work. Minimal editing may be provided by your supervisor(s) or peers but only as a review of initial drafts.  Do not seek assistance from OIST internal or paid external editing services, unless directed to do so by the Dean in revision stages.

\section{Intellectual property and copyright}

The student will retain copyright of the published work, in perpetuity.  The student acknowledges that OIST remains the owner of the intellectual property generated by the research presented in the thesis and that publication of the thesis under the author's copyright does not diminish this claim.  The thesis will be published online in electronic form within one year of graduation.


 \section{Submission of temporary and bound versions}

The thesis will be submitted first in printed form in a style formatted to assist the examination process (single side printing, double spacing, temporary binding).  Three copies of the examination version must be bound in temporary form (using the comb binder available in the Graduate School office, or with a glued spine cloth).  Soft plastic end covers may be used. This version should include (inserted after the thesis itself) any papers published during the tenure of the thesis that are relevant to the material therein, for the convenience of the examiners.  A digital version of the same file in PDF (without the ``published papers'' appendix) must be submitted to the Graduate School at the same time as your printed version.  This may be submitted using internal file-sharing provisions (eg, Filesender).

The submitted examination thesis should be accompanied by a Declaration from the Supervisor (see Appendix 4 for template).  The purpose of the Declaration, which should be completed and signed by the thesis supervisor, is to acknowledge that the work was done in the laboratory of the supervisor, that any co-authors of included material have consented to such inclusion, and that there is no unauthorised use of material for which the copyright is held by other parties.  The Declaration  will be retained by the Graduate School, and will not be part of the thesis sent for examination or published later.

\section{Examination Workflow}

The two external examiners will review the written thesis and prepare a report.  When the marked thesis is returned (with annotations) the student will be required to make the stipulated revisions, and must then confirm with the Graduate School that the revisions are accepted and complete within one month.  The revisions of the thesis should be prepared in the same format as the examination copy. Once the revised version of the thesis is approved, the student will then be eligible to defend the thesis in an oral examination.  Additional minor revisions (mostly text-based) may be requested after the oral examination, and should be completed as soon as possible.  Theses with minor revisions completed should then be submitted electronically, as PDF, for approval.  Once approved, no additional changes may be made.  The final ``publication version'' of the thesis must be submitted as an electronic file in PDF format, double paged and single spaced (see above).  Once the degree has been awarded, the electronic file will be published online by the Graduate School in the OIST Institutional Repository.

The student should also prepare a permanent bound version of the final publication thesis (essentially the same as the PDF with altered margins as needed) to present to the supervisor(s), according to the format described in this document.  The bound version must be submitted before the degree may be awarded.  The Graduate School will cover necessary costs for binding the supervisor copy (or copies).
